Done so far:
Got rid of Person class, Trainer now inherites User without overriding his methods. He will simply be able to train and eat as well. I hve written as a comment that he maybe would be his trainer, but i will do it later.

Worked the User class, implemented his Eat and Train methods. Training is actually moved in Trainings classes, because different type of trainings do different things. Used virtual methods, a possible subject for later refactoring.

Worked on Trainings classes, added a few properties in the Food class as well
